# CIS550Project

Welcome to FlavorFinder! FlavorFinder is designed to help alleviate the pain point of having certain ingredients and not knowing what to do with them either before they go bad as well as inspiring creativity in the kitchen. This project is designed to create and make an interactive interface that helps users select a recipe based on desired ingredients, ingredient quantities, nutritional value, prep time, cook time, recipe reviews, and so much more! 

To launch FlavorFinder, cd into the server and run 'npm start' in the terminal and then cd into the client and run 'npm start' this will allow for the client to open up which is hosted at: http://localhost:3000/.

Due to large file limitations on github, we are storing the cleaned datasets on our personal google drives as opposed to github.
