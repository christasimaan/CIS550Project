# CIS550Project

Hi! Welcome to our CIS5500 Project Repository. Our group is creating a website that helps users select a recipe based on desired ingredients, ingredient quantities, nutritional value, and recipe reviews. Our main motivation for doing this is to resolve the pain point of having certain ingredients and not knowing what to make with them either before they go bad as well as inspiring creativity in the kitchen!

Due to large file limitations on github, we are storing the cleaned datasets on our personal google drives as opposed to github.
